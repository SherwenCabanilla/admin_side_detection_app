# User Deletion Implementation - Summary

## Problem

When deleting users, only the Firestore document was deleted, leaving:

- ❌ Orphaned Firebase Authentication accounts
- ❌ User could potentially still sign in
- ❌ Associated scan requests not cleaned up

## Solution

Implemented a Cloud Function that properly deletes:

- ✅ Firebase Authentication account
- ✅ Firestore user document
- ✅ Only pending scan requests (preserves completed/reviewed scans)
- ✅ Secure admin-only access

## Files Changed

### 1. `functions/index.js`

**Added:**

- New Cloud Function: `deleteUserAccount`
- Imports: `onCall` from firebase-functions/v2/https
- Admin verification logic
- Complete user deletion (Auth + Firestore + scan requests)

### 2. `lib/models/user_store.dart`

**Modified:**

- Added import: `cloud_functions` package
- Updated `deleteUser()` method to call Cloud Function
- Added fallback mechanism for graceful degradation
- Better error handling and logging

### 3. `pubspec.yaml`

**Added:**

- `cloud_functions: ^4.6.5` dependency

### 4. Documentation

**Created:**

- `USER_DELETION_GUIDE.md` - Complete implementation guide
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## How to Deploy

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Flutter
flutter pub get

# Cloud Functions
cd functions
npm install
cd ..
```

### 2. Deploy Cloud Function

```bash
firebase deploy --only functions:deleteUserAccount
```

### 3. Deploy Web App (if needed)

```bash
flutter build web
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run `flutter pub get` to install cloud_functions package
- [ ] Deploy the Cloud Function: `firebase deploy --only functions:deleteUserAccount`
- [ ] Test deleting a user from admin panel
- [ ] Verify in Firebase Console:
  - [ ] Auth account is deleted
  - [ ] Firestore document is deleted
  - [ ] Only pending scan requests are deleted (completed ones preserved)
- [ ] Check function logs: `firebase functions:log --only deleteUserAccount`

## Benefits

1. **Security**: Properly removes all user access
2. **Data Cleanup**: Removes orphaned pending requests
3. **Data Preservation**: Keeps completed scans for historical records
4. **Audit Trail**: All deletions are logged
5. **Reliability**: Fallback mechanism if Cloud Function fails
6. **Best Practice**: Follows Firebase recommended approach

## Notes

- The Cloud Function is region-specific: `us-central1`
- Only authenticated admins can delete users
- Gracefully handles cases where Auth account doesn't exist
- All operations are logged for debugging
