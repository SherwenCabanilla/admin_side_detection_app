# Updated Implementation - Scan Request Deletion Policy

## 🎯 Important Update!

Based on your feedback, I've updated the user deletion logic to be **smarter about scan requests**.

## What Changed

### ❌ Previous Version (5 minutes ago)

- Deleted **ALL** scan requests when user was deleted
- Lost completed expert reviews
- Removed valuable historical data

### ✅ Current Version (NOW)

- Deletes **ONLY pending** scan requests
- **Preserves completed/reviewed** scan requests
- Maintains expert work and historical records

## Why This Matters

### For Pending Users (Not Approved Yet)

When you **reject** a user registration request:

1. ✅ Delete their Firebase Auth account
2. ✅ Delete their Firestore user document
3. ✅ Delete any PENDING scan requests they created
4. ✅ Keep any COMPLETED scans (if they somehow got expert review)

### For Active Users (Already Approved)

When you **delete** an active user:

1. ✅ Delete their Firebase Auth account
2. ✅ Delete their Firestore user document
3. ✅ Delete any PENDING scan requests
4. ✅ **Preserve COMPLETED scans** - these represent expert work!

## Code Changes

### Cloud Function (functions/index.js)

```javascript
// OLD - deleted all scan requests
.where("userId", "==", userId)

// NEW - deletes only pending scan requests
.where("userId", "==", userId)
.where("status", "==", "pending")  // ← Added this filter
```

### Return Value Updated

```javascript
// OLD
deletedScanRequests: deletePromises.length;

// NEW
deletedPendingScanRequests: deletePromises.length;
```

### Flutter Service (lib/models/user_store.dart)

```dart
// Updated log message
print('Deleted ${data['deletedPendingScanRequests']} pending scan requests');
print('Note: Completed/reviewed scans are preserved for historical records');
```

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Preserves Expert Work**: Completed reviews are not lost
2. ✅ **Historical Data**: Disease tracking data remains intact
3. ✅ **Clean Deletion**: Removes incomplete/orphaned pending requests
4. ✅ **Audit Trail**: Completed scans serve as system history
5. ✅ **Analytics**: Preserved data can be used for reports/patterns

## What Gets Deleted vs Preserved

| Data Type     | Status    | Action       | Reason                       |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Firebase Auth | -         | ✅ Deleted   | User cannot sign in          |
| User Document | -         | ✅ Deleted   | Remove personal data         |
| Scan Request  | Pending   | ✅ Deleted   | Incomplete, no value         |
| Scan Request  | Completed | ❌ Preserved | Expert work, historical data |
| Scan Request  | Reviewed  | ❌ Preserved | Expert diagnosis preserved   |
| Activity Logs | -         | ❌ Preserved | Audit trail                  |

## Deployment

### No Changes to Deployment Process!

```bash
# Same steps as before
firebase deploy --only functions:deleteUserAccount
```

The function will now:

- Only delete pending scan requests
- Preserve completed scan requests
- Log the difference in console

## Testing

### Expected Console Output:

```
deleteUserAccount: Deleting user abc123 by admin xyz789
deleteUserAccount: Successfully deleted auth account for abc123
deleteUserAccount: Successfully deleted Firestore doc for abc123
deleteUserAccount: Deleted 3 pending scan requests for user abc123
← Note: Only pending requests deleted, completed ones preserved
```

### Verify in Firestore:

After deleting a user:

1. Check `/scan_requests` collection
2. Filter by the deleted `userId`
3. You should still see records with `status: "completed"`
4. You should NOT see any with `status: "pending"`

## Example Scenario

```
User: Maria Garcia (ID: user123)

Before Deletion:
├─ Scan Request A: Mango Anthracnose - Status: "pending" ← Will be deleted
├─ Scan Request B: Powdery Mildew - Status: "completed" ← Will be kept
├─ Scan Request C: Leaf Spot - Status: "pending" ← Will be deleted
└─ Scan Request D: Sooty Mold - Status: "reviewed" ← Will be kept

After Deletion:
├─ Auth Account: DELETED ✓
├─ User Document: DELETED ✓
├─ Scan Request A: DELETED ✓
├─ Scan Request B: EXISTS (preserved) ✓
├─ Scan Request C: DELETED ✓
└─ Scan Request D: EXISTS (preserved) ✓

Result: User deleted, 2 pending scans removed, 2 completed scans preserved
```

## Quick Reference

**Q: What happens to user's pending scan requests?**
A: Deleted - they were incomplete anyway

**Q: What happens to user's completed scan requests?**  
A: Preserved - they contain expert work and historical data

**Q: What happens to user's authentication?**
A: Deleted - they cannot sign in anymore

**Q: What happens to user's personal data?**
A: Deleted - removed from `/users` collection

**Q: Can deleted user still access the app?**
A: No - their Firebase Auth account is deleted

---

## Summary

This implementation now properly balances:

- **Data Privacy**: User auth and personal data removed
- **Data Preservation**: Expert reviews and historical scans kept
- **Data Cleanup**: Incomplete pending requests removed

**This is the smart, correct approach!** 🎉

Deploy with confidence:

```bash
firebase deploy --only functions:deleteUserAccount
```
